## Configuration
=======
Configuration
---------------
>>>>>>> master
SmartSweeper can be configured by modifying .env in the root directory. The app will create it for you the first time you load it, but you can create the file yourself prior to that, which will help if you didn't use the default SmartCash installation path. The default values for Windows are shown below.
```
rpc.host=127.0.0.1
rpc.port=9678
rpc.username=rpcusername
rpc.password=rpcpassword
smartcashPath=C:\Program Files\SmartCash\
```

* rpc.host is the IP address that the SmartCash Node Client RPC server is bound to.
<<<<<<< HEAD
* rpc.port is the port that the SmartCash Node Client RPC server is listening on.
=======
* rpc.port is the port that the SmartCash node client RPC server is listening on.
>>>>>>> master
* rpc.username is the SmartCash Node Client RPC server username.
* rpc.password is the SmartCash Node Client RPC server password.
* smartcashPath is the full path to your SmartCash Node Client installation. You must include a trailing slash.

Your SmartCash Node Client must be started with the following arguments:
```
=======
Your SmartCash wallet must be started with the following arguments:
```
-txindex=1 (if SmartCash Node Client is < v1.2.3)
>>>>>>> master
-server
-rpcbind=127.0.0.1
-rpcport=9678
-rpcuser=rpcusername
-rpcpassword=rpcpassword
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
If it isn't running, SmartSweeper will attempt to start it for you with the above arguments. You can also [edit your node client's smartcash.conf file](https://smartcash.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/35000038702-smartcash-conf-configuration-file). Please don't do this with your client running.

>>>>>>> master
server=1
rpcbind=127.0.0.1
rpcport=9678
rpcuser=rpcusername
rpcpassword=rpcpassword
```

The values of rpc.host, rpc.port, rpc.username, and rpc.password in .env must match those in the program arguments or the smartcash.conf file.

#### User files
The database (smart-sweeper.json), the app config file (smart-sweeper-config.json), the saved dashboard data file (smart-sweeper-data.json) and the log files are saved in the following folder:

* **Windows**: %APPDATA%/SmartSweeper

**It is strongly recommended that you regularly back up smart-sweeper.json to a safe place.**

The log files are also in JSON format and can be viewed with a general log viewer such as [glogg](https://github.com/nickbnf/glogg). The user logs record user actions while the system logs record system actions and errors (and includes transaction ids and public keys).


## Known issues
* SmartSweeper may not open the SmartCash Node Client. If smartcash.conf hasn't been modified with the info above, SmartSweeper won't work if the node client is run manually.
* electron-store error "EPERM operation not permitted" sometimes occurs on Windows when reading a config file. SmartSweeper will exit when it does.
* Can't connect to the node client via RPC when it's syncing (SmartSweeper will display the "Can't connect to SmartCash Node Client." error). This will cause some actions to fail and some project data updates to not occur.
* Claimed funds info on the dashboard and the sweep funds page becomes inaccurate after one or more projects have been swept.
* Empty log files are sometimes created in the root SmartSweeper data folder.
* There is lag when entering text into input fields.
